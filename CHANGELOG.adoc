= Changelog

NOTE: This changelog only covers the actual tool (`update-center2-x.y.z.jar`), not changes to the wrapper scripts or metadata.

* * Improve robustness with unexpected version number formats (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/pull/624[#624])

* Do not include the host name in the Artifactory cache key for SHA-256 based cache entries (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/pull/613[#613])
